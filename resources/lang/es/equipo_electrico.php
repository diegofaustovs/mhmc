Our motivation for working in SDLAC, is being able to apply our theoretical knowledge in a viable and feasible project. We are motivated by the possibility of creating a design replicable in several communities, as well as becoming a national and worldwide referent in the design of user-friendly and efficient electrical networks. This is why we are working in our design form electrical and electronics engineering, in order to achieve our objectives, by designing the photovoltaic system of the house, the electrical network, and the automation and communications solutions.',
